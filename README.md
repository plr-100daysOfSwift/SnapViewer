Milestone 4

## Challenge

[Link](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-classic/5/3/challenge)

The challenge is to put two different projects into one: let users take photos of things that interest them, add captions to them, then show those photos in a table view. Tapping the caption should show the picture in a new view controller, as in project 1. The finished project needs to use elements from both project 1 and project 12.

This will require you to use the picker.sourceType = .camera setting for your image picker controller, create a custom type that stores a filename and a caption, then show the list of saved pictures in a table view.
